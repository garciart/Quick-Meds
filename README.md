# Project Quick Emergency Medical Reference (Quick EMR)
The Quick EMR allows providers in the field to quickly identify commonly-prescribed medications to extrapolate patient histories and provide rapid and correct care.

As a Firefighter/Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), I run into quite a few patients who have no idea what their medications are or what condition the medications are supposed to treat. When you hold up a pill bottle and ask them about it, the patient will say something along the lines of, "I think that one is for my sugar (i.e., diabetes)." Sometimes, the patient will forget about a condition completely. If I see a bottle of Apixaban, known as Eliquis, the patient may say, "It's for my legs." Eliquis is actually an anticoagulant used to treat stroke victims and/or patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). A patient who has fallen and is taking Eliquis may actually "bleed out" internally without realizing it, because the medication is keeping the blood from clotting normally.

Therefore, I first came up with a two-sided sheet of paper, which listed cross-referenced the brand name, generic name, and purpose of the top 200 medications pharmacists are supposed to know. The list worked great at identifying medications, as well as assisting me in getting a better picture of a patient's history.

For my capstone project for my bachelor's degree, I decided to create an "interactive" reference, on a web site that was accessible on my phone. This way, I could have the list with me when I entered the patient's home, instead of leaving the paper in the ambulance. The project earned me an A and has worked out great in the field. Here, I've decided to share the code, written for Java Server Pages (JSP) with you, in case you have a similar issue. Eventually, I will port this to Xamarin, and I hope the code will help you with your own projects!
